## Course Reflection :smiley:
### step 2

I chose to enroll in Introduction to Digital Humanities, drawn by a fascination with how technology intersects with the arts and sciences to create new fields of study. This course stood out as a stepping stone for exploring the evolving landscape of digital literacy, promising a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application. The allure of the class was magnified by the prospect of collaborating with classmates from a wide array of disciplines. The diversity in academic backgrounds—ranging from Computer Science to Interactive Media, and extending to Film and New Media, Environmental Studies, Business and Marketing, Literature, and Creative Writing—promised a rich tapestry of perspectives and methodologies, setting the stage for a truly interdisciplinary learning experience.

This unique constellation of majors among my peers not only made class discussions more enriching but also expanded my understanding of digital literacy beyond my major's confines. Each of us entered the classroom with our digital toolkits, shaped by our respective fields. My background in Interactive Media gets me familiar with digital tools like Adobe and visualization skills. Meanwhile, my peers brought their own expertise to the table:Computer Science majors are equipped with a solid foundation in coding languages such as Python and Java, skills they had previously applied to software development and data manipulation. Film and New Media enthusiasts shared insights into multimedia production and narrative creation.

Alongside the digital humanities course, I'm enrolled in an Intro to Computer Science class. The synergy between these two courses has been unexpectedly profound, enriching my learning experience in both domains. The Computer Science class has provided me with a foundational understanding of programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures, which has been invaluable. Conversely, the digital humanities course has offered me a broader perspective on how these technical skills can be applied creatively to analyze and interpret digital data within the humanities.
The course revealed how digital humanities bridge disparate disciplines, fostering a collaborative environment where content creation transcends traditional boundaries. We delved into projects that ranged from building interactive websites to crafting digital art installations and from developing immersive narratives to generating AI-powered content. Through these endeavors, we not only blurred the lines between art, science, and storytelling but also discovered the importance of social interaction and collaboration in the digital age.

Platforms such as Slack, Discord, and online forums became vital spaces for idea exchange, sparking discussions that crossed the boundaries of our individual expertise. This environment encouraged us to engage in thought-provoking dialogues, enriching our perspectives and fostering a culture of innovation. The course emphasized the value of interdisciplinary collaboration, revealing how it can act as a catalyst for creativity and new ways of thinking.

A common theme that emerged from our collective efforts was the significance of research data management and manipulation. We explored various tools and methods for text analysis, data visualization, and digital archiving, recognizing the universal need for data literacy across disciplines. Halfway through the semester, I found myself intrigued by possibilities of distant reading through data visualization tools like Voyant and word cloud. I also learned bunches of new terminologies and concepts like OCR((Optical Character Recognition)and API(Application Programming Interface). These revelations not only expanded my digital vocabulary but also opened my eyes to novel approaches in digital humanities. Our critical reflections on these experiences underscored the relevance of computational thinking in today's AI-driven landscape, highlighting the necessity for skills in data analysis, algorithm understanding, and result interpretation, irrespective of our majors.

We studied the intriguing field of Sufi Arts and its incorporation into the digital world in one of our seminars. This subject proved to be interesting and educational as well, especially for someone like me who wasn't really familiar with Sufi arts. One thing in particular drew my attention as we studied Sufi culture and expression: the use of programming to create Sufi poetry.
The concept of using programming languages to craft Sufi poetry intrigued me deeply. Essentially, the process involves extracting words from Sufi texts and arranging them into poetic sequences using Python programming. The beauty of these poems lies in their randomness—words are drawn from Sufi literature without predetermined order, and Python's algorithm orchestrates them into cohesive and aesthetically pleasing compositions.

The concept of digital religion has become popular these years. I’m personally more familiar with Buddhism. In China, “Cyber Buddhism” is a popular notion among the young generation.
"Cyber Buddhism" represents a contemporary adaptation of Buddhist practices and teachings within the digital realm. One fascinating example of this is the concept of the "cyber wooden fish." Traditionally, the wooden fish, or "muyu," is a percussion instrument used in Buddhist rituals to maintain rhythm during chanting and meditation sessions. In the digital context, the cyber wooden fish takes on a virtual form, serving as a digital tool for mindfulness and meditation practices.


Another inspiring class that caught my interests revolves around spatial projects. I think it’s highly relevant to my major. In the Article *Map, Mapping and the Visual Arts*, the author Lou Cabeen mentioned some strategies that artists can utilize. 


>Incorporating Maps: Artists integrated actual maps or mapping elements into their artworks, blurring the lines between representation and abstraction. By using maps as visual components, artists could evoke a sense of real-world geography while exploring abstract forms and concepts.

>Exploring Spatial Relationships: Artists focused on depicting spatial relationships in their works, using abstract forms to convey a sense of place and movement. Through the manipulation of space and form, artists could create visual narratives that resonated with viewers on a personal and emotional level 

>Embracing Hybrid Approaches: Artists adopted hybrid approaches that combined elements of traditional art-making with mapping techniques. By merging different visual languages and methodologies, artists could create artworks that challenged conventional notions of representation and abstraction .

>Engaging with Viewers' Experiences: Artists aimed to tap into viewers' own experiences of space by presenting artworks that called forth memories and perceptions of the world. By emphasizing what is given over personal emotion, artists created works that established a direct relationship with viewers, inviting them to engage with the artwork on a deeper level .

>Resolving the "Crisis of Representation": Artists sought to resolve the tension between representation and abstraction by using maps as a means to navigate the complexities of visual language. By acknowledging the subjective nature of maps as human products, artists could create artworks that functioned as abstract representations of objective reality, offering viewers a unique perspective on the world.

In a nutshell, this course has been an eye-opening adventure, encouraging multidisciplinary cooperation and strengthening my digital knowledge. Discussions on Sufi Arts and digital religion extended my ideas, while research of spatial initiatives provided fresh perspectives on art and mapping. The course's emphasis on research data management, computational thinking, and collaborative problem-solving has given me the skills I need for my major in the digital era and embrace multidisciplinary collaboration.
